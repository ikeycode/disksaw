# sawdisk

WARNING: This is still a toy! It is not ready for production use, and might never become ready!

A WIP tool leveraging [disks-rs](https://github.com/serpent-os/disks-rs) to provide a simple CLI for managing disks.

The goal is to provide a playground in which to refine the API of `disks-rs`, extending the functionality for "free"
to support other use cases in Serpent OS, such as our installer, [lichen](https://github.com/serpent-os/lichen).
